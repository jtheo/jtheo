# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Matteo.


I wanted to be a programmer since I was eight when I saw a Mainframe. I have had or used [Vic20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIC-20), [Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga), [PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer), and [Minix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minix); but then life happened.

In the last few years, I discovered [Go](https://github.com/golang/go), and it's been love at first sight; I am still an amateur but improving.

I've been playing with Unix/Linux for 35 years. I wrote more (BA|K)SH code than I want to admit.

I moved to London in 2015, looking for something new to learn and to do.

I've also been playing with Lego since I was a kid, and I still do it.

I'm hungry for TV series, in particular Sci-Fi and BBC.

- I'm not burned out; I'm only a bit chargrilled.
